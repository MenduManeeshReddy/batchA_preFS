Suraj and Tom are two best friends. 

Both of them have given two Strings S1 and S2 
Suraj has given String S1 and Tom has given String S2
Suraj is always bothered about Tom Strings and checks if's  his string follows sSequence of Tom strings or not 

Help Suraj to solve his problem 

A sSequence of  string is a new string which is formed from the original string by removing some (can be none) of the characters without
disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.
